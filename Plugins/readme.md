### **Welcome to Walton Robotics's Shuffleboard Plugins!**

The plugins that we currently have in this library:
  * DynamicButtonMap Widget (For use with our DynamicButtonMap)
  * Walton Robotics Theme

If you want to install these for yourself, you can grab the .jar file from /build/libs/ or run the 
"install" Gradle task. There will likely be a released version of the .jar in the future.
